# Solidity_DEX_Project

Developed an ETH decentralized exchange (DEX) for Ethereum Smart Contract Programming 201 with Ivan on Tech Academy.  The DEX uses order books to handle Limit and Market orders.  

Key lessons learned:
- payable functions
- Moving a project from Remix to Truffle
- deploying with Truffle
- Contract Inheritance
- Open Zeppelin to work with ERC20, ERC721 and MathSafe
- Debugging
- Test driven development with Truffle
- Logic with order books
